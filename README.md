# Tic Tac Toe

A two-player game wherein each player take a turn to mark a 3x3 grid with 
mark X or O. The winner is the player who successfully places three
of their marks sequentially in the horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows 
of the tic-tac-toe board.

This app allows you to play against a friend or the computer -- at 
various difficulties levels (easy, medium, or hard).
